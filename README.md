# Smooth Scroll

This is an extension for Visual Studio that adds smooth scrolling to the text editor.  It works best with a mouse pad or track pad that supports two-finger scrolling or a real mouse with a continuous wheel.

It's not complicated.  It gives you buttery smooth two-finger scrolling just like your favorite browser instead of the chunky seven lines per click scrolling built into Visual Studio.

### Installation

To install the extension, either use _Tools &rarr; Extensions and Updates&hellip;_ or go to the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5fcc21b1-2c9b-4768-a5da-e309811d6b9e).
