# Smooth Scroll

This is an extension for Visual Studio that adds smooth scrolling to the text editor.  It works best with a mouse pad or track pad that supports two-finger scrolling or a real mouse with a continuous wheel.

It's not complicated.  It gives you buttery smooth scrolling just like your favorite browser instead of the chunky seven lines per click scrolling built into Visual Studio.  Also works in the output window!

### Installation

To install the extension, either use _Tools &rarr; Extensions and Updates&hellip;_ or go to the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5fcc21b1-2c9b-4768-a5da-e309811d6b9e).
